# Learning-By-Doing Practice :  Smarttours 🧐

 

I've just started to learn `Html CSS JavaScript`. 
After finishing my first course about HTML CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.
I decided to check myself and create a simple website with no starter code. 


That was one of my first websites. I am planning to create this website more modern and without bugs in the future .
