# Learning-By-Doing Practice :  Smarttours 🧐

 

I've just started to learn `Html CSS JavaScript`. 
After finishing my first course about Front End Web Development.
I decided to check myself and create a simple website with no starter code. 


That was one of my first projects. 

I did this project 17 months ago. Now  I see I made a lot of mistakes there. 
I decided to create a new repo and write code for this website one more time , focusing on Accessibility, Responsive, Semantic HTML, Google Lighthouse

## Below is a link to the current repository for this project
